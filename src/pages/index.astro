            <p>
              Suyash Nagumalli was born in <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Des_Plaines,_Illinois">Des Plaines, Illinois</a>, and moved to
              <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyderabad">Hyderabad, India</a> at the age of four. He studied at
              <a class="link" href="https://glendaleschool.org/in/">Glendale Academy</a> from grades 1 through 12, where his love for computers and creativity took root.
            </p>
            <p>
              He began learning computer science in 5th grade and by 6th grade was exploring QBasic, Java, C++, HTML, cybersecurity, hardware, and software fundamentals.
              A top performer in academics, he scored 6 A*s and 2 As in his IGCSE 10th-grade finals, and was the topper in Math, Computer Science, and Physics in Grade 12. He built his first game, multiplayer Hand Cricket, using Python and SQL, which was featured in his school's Science Fair — a defining moment that led him to pursue Computer Science in college.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of school, Suyash was an avid athlete: a state-level qualifier in <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roller_skating">roller speed skating</a>, an inter-school competitive swimmer, and a district-level sprinter in the 100m and 4x100m relay.
              He served as Willow House Captain in 12th grade, demonstrating leadership and commitment beyond the classroom.

              During his undergraduate studies, Suyash participated in the 2022 Jump ARCHES Summer Internship Program at UIUC's Health Care Engineering Systems Center (HCESC). He worked on developing a virtual reality training module for Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) procedures, creating an accessible simulation for medical professionals.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2023, while interning at AbbVie Innovation Center as a virtual reality developer, Suyash received the Best Business Innovation Award at UIUC Research Park for creating a virtual environment to simulate the patient screening process. His supervisor praised his initiative, leadership, and innovative thinking in tackling a project that required him to learn new technologies and programming languages.
            </p>
            <p>
              More recently, Suyash built an MVP prompt library to aid in clinical Trial document generation at AbbVie, leading to a $2 million contract with a consultant firm to build out the vision.

            <p>
              Beyond his academic and professional pursuits, Suyash has been involved in educational initiatives for underprivileged children. He tutored mathematics to children at a local government school in India as part of an after-school program, providing them with the individual attention they needed. He also worked with academically strong students to help them prepare for competitive exams.
            </p>
            <p>
              To promote educational equity, Suyash shared videos of his tutoring sessions on social media, encouraging others with education to contribute similarly to help disadvantaged children around the world receive the education they deserve.

              When he's not coding or composing, Suyash is a marathon runner, cultural performer, and storyteller.
