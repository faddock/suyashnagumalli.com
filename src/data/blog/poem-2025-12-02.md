description: An experience of reading in a library
---

"Silence in the library", a greeting.  
Barebacks lined up, hottest best-sellers,  
teasing me to touch their pages.  

I pick her and sit on the fireplace chair-
heat emanates. My palms trace her spine,  
I undress the cover.  

Fingertips on the margins of naked pages.  
Feeling the rough paper and smooth plastic, 
I surrender to the ink.

Each chapter so intricate.  
I lay her body firm on the armrest,  
settle the bookmark into her tender center.  

My brain high on endorphins,  
I close my eyes, 
breathe in.

I place the hottest best-seller 
back on the shelf,
still warm from my palms.
