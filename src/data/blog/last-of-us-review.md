### Foreword

When I found myself with more than a text message worth of comments on The Last of Us, I knew it deserved a dedicated review. Below is my honest take on Seasons 1 and 2—straight from someone who’s never played the games and is stepping into this world for the very first time.

### Season 1

Season 1 was simply beautiful. It’s the best mainstream video-game adaptation I've seen since the dissapointing Assassin's Creed movie. The pacing was spot-on, giving the main characters room to breathe and grow. And wow, the unalived count is ludicrous, which just underscores how brutal their world really is. Joel and Ellie’s chemistry felt genuine—I love how she’s a relentless youthful chatterbox full of puns and excitement for the static remains of 2003 Earth, while Joel is her silent, stoic opposite. I could feel the excitement of her discovering things like the escalator - it was maybe a little cheesy but I loved the writing and acting. The show’s portrayal of a post-apocalyptic world hit close to home in the wake of COVID-19. They nailed the element of divulging the science behind how the fungus originated, spreads and the weakenesses of the host - something that A Quiet Place also does brilliantly. Visually, it nails that “video-game” look: the graphics and sets are so detailed, with breathtaking pan-out shots from skyscrapers and streets and reminded me of Uncharted 4 the video game. Frank’s storyline and his self-sufficient lifestyle with gardens and guns and defense in his own town was so so satisfying. That was honestly the best part of season 1.

I will say, though—Season 1 (and even Season 2) puts more emphasis on queer relationships than I expected. I found myself missing the classic male-female dynamic (though I know this is the trend now—even Indian shows like Royals are embracing it). That aside, the scene where Sam and his brother meet their fate is gut-wrenchingly real and a testament to how much Ellie endures. The finale is paced to perfection: Joel’s descent into “bad guy” territory feels inevitable. The fact that he slaughters everyone—even Marlene—just to keep Ellie for himself is harrowing. That moral ambiguity strikes the perfect balance between hero and villain, making Season 1 an absolutely incredible ride.

### Season 2

Season 2 really threw me for a loop. I get that Ellie’s driven by revenge, but she doesn’t even seem to want it that badly—there’s just this resigned, “Oh well, I guess I have to go kill Abby now” vibe. She's lost her charm from season 1, and doesn’t have a vengeful fire like that of Abby when she killed Joel-that second episode was absolutely riveting: Abby’s life hanging by a thread, Joel saving her, and then her turning around and killing him—it’s brutal, shocking, and a little sad. Joel’s weakened mental health and age led to his natural instincts failing him. Abby's vilanous monologue also was quite cheesy to be honest - it could've been better.

I was pretty disappointed that Joel died so early and so brutally. It feels like every character in this show literally kills the moment they see adversity. On the upside, I was pleasantly surprised by Dina—she’s gorgeous (I totally had a crush on her). Her and the cast's acting is genuinely fantastic, but the storytelling gets weird: our main cast is in the middle of a war in Seattle, the infected become side characters like Goombas in Mario, and it’s all about revenge, revenge, revenge, rather than about post-apocalytpic survival, which is what I really liked about season 1.

Ellie’s personality really grates on me—and the writers really seem to like having someone miraculously rescue her right when she’s about to die—Jesse saves her twice, even though he doesn’t know she’s immune. Speaking of Jesse, he’s awesome and loyal and handsome, but I wonder what Dina sees in Ellie—sure, she’s quirky and gay and her bestfriend, but I'm startled how Dina sees a future where Ellie replaces the older, wiser and capable Jesse as a parent.

Despite all that, there are some beautiful moments. Dina plotting their routes is nerdy and badass, the skyscraper shots and video game sets are so so beautiful just like in Season 1. And the guitar scene at the end, with Ellie tuning the guitar by ear(very impressive) and Dina shedding a tear, is really touching. The emotional trauma piled onto Ellie—sudden deaths, brutal losses—feels excessive, but it’s also what makes the show so exciting that things are actually happening.

I did wish Ellie had saved that baby in the end. If she’s responsible enough to take action about Dina’s pregnancy and dream of raising another couple’s child, she could’ve at least been more responsible in that moment. Regardless, it was heart-wrenching to watch two enemies instantly switch modes - beautifully acted.

### Final Thoughts

It feels like from now on the show will focus more on new characters, and that’s something I struggle with in TV series. You get attached to a core group, and then the next season they’re gone and it’s all just about the world they inhabit. Agree or not, I’d stay in the Season 1 world forever. It’s the same with Arcane—Season 2 was so different that it barely felt like the same show. Maybe someone will come along and direct a limited-series where the second season surpasses the first, but I haven’t found one yet.
