Dear reader, during my senior year of college, I enrolled myself in a poetry class. This collection explores various emotions I've felt from events that transpired as I attempt to understand myself and the people around me. I am extremely grateful to my classmates and our instructor, Erin Stoodley, for their invaluable support. I present to the reader, the three poems from my final portfolio.
